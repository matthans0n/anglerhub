The goals table enables flexible goal setting and progress tracking:
- Goal types: species, weight, count, location, custom
- Flexible criteria storage (JSON)
- Progress tracking with automated calculations
- Timeline management with start/target dates
- Status management: active, completed, paused, cancelled
