# Photo Storage Solutions Research

## Executive Summary

Photo storage is critical for **AC-2** (catch logging with photos) and **AC-3** (viewing catch history). Research identifies a hybrid Cloudinary + S3 approach that provides automatic compression, fast CDN delivery, and cost optimization to handle 200-1000 users averaging 2-5 photos per catch within budget constraints.

## Key Requirements from ACs/Examples

### AC-2: Personal Catch Logging
- Photo uploads with timestamp and location metadata
- Image processing and compression for storage efficiency
- Support for mobile photo capture in various lighting conditions
- Integration with Laravel backend for seamless upload workflow

### AC-3: Catch History & Search
- Thumbnail generation for list views
- Full-size image display in detail views
- Fast loading across different connection speeds
- Progressive loading for mobile users

### AC-9: Offline Functionality
- Photo capture and local storage when offline
- Automatic upload when connectivity restored
- Cache management for frequently viewed images

### EX-2: Field Photo Logging Scenario
1. User takes photo of catch in the field
2. Photo automatically compressed and processed
3. Metadata (GPS, timestamp) preserved or optionally stripped
4. Upload queued for when connectivity available
5. Thumbnail generated for immediate preview

## Research Findings

### Cloudinary - Primary Image Management Solution

**Free Tier Analysis:**
- 25 credits monthly (no time limit)
- 1 credit = 1,000 transformations, 1GB storage, or 1GB bandwidth
- For fishing app: 3,000 images with compression ≈ 6 credits + 3GB storage ≈ 9 credits
- **Remaining 16 credits (16GB) available for monthly bandwidth delivery**

**Key Features for Fishing Apps:**
- **Automatic Compression:** Dynamic optimization without quality loss
- **Multiple Format Support:** WebP, AVIF for modern browsers, JPEG fallback
- **Real-time Transformations:** Resize images on-the-fly for different views
- **CDN Delivery:** Global multi-CDN network for fast worldwide access
- **Laravel Integration:** Native PHP SDK with seamless framework integration

**Pricing Beyond Free Tier:**
- Next tier accommodates higher usage as app scales
- Predictable credit-based pricing model
- Pay only for actual usage (storage + transformations + bandwidth)

### AWS S3 - Long-term Archive Storage

**Cost Benefits:**
- Extremely low storage costs for archival
- No egress fees when used with Cloudinary integration
- Reliable, scalable infrastructure
- Easy Laravel integration

**Hybrid Storage Strategy:**
1. **Active Photos (0-30 days):** Stored in Cloudinary for fast access and transformations
2. **Archived Photos (30+ days):** Moved to S3 for cost-effective long-term storage
3. **On-demand Access:** Fetch from S3 and process through Cloudinary when needed

### Cost Optimization Strategy

**Smart Lifecycle Management:**
```php
// Example lifecycle strategy
- Day 0-30: Cloudinary (active transformations, fast CDN)
- Day 30+: Archive to S3 (cheap storage)
- On-access: Fetch from S3, process via Cloudinary, cache result
```

**Benefits of Hybrid Approach:**
- Keeps active images in fast CDN with transformations
- Reduces Cloudinary storage credits by archiving old photos
- Maintains access to all historical photos
- Proven successful in keeping costs "well below plan limits" even at scale

### Image Processing Pipeline

**Automatic Optimization:**
- **Compression:** Intelligent quality optimization (typically 70-80% quality)
- **Format Selection:** WebP for modern browsers, JPEG for legacy
- **Responsive Sizing:** Multiple sizes generated (thumbnail, medium, full)
- **EXIF Handling:** Optional metadata stripping for privacy

**Laravel Integration Example:**
```php
// Cloudinary upload with automatic optimization
$uploadResult = cloudinary()->upload($image_path, [
    'quality' => 'auto',
    'fetch_format' => 'auto',
    'width' => 1200,
    'height' => 800,
    'crop' => 'limit'
]);

// Generate thumbnail URL
$thumbnail = cloudinary()->image($publicId)
    ->resize(scale(300, 200))
    ->toUrl();
```

## Storage Requirements Analysis

### User Growth Projections
- **MVP:** 200 users × 4 catches/month × 3 photos = 2,400 photos/month
- **Growth:** 1000 users × 6 catches/month × 3 photos = 18,000 photos/month

### Storage Calculations
- **Average Photo Size:** 2-3MB (smartphone cameras)
- **Compressed Size:** 200-500KB (Cloudinary optimization)
- **Monthly Storage (MVP):** 2,400 × 0.3MB ≈ 720MB
- **Monthly Storage (Growth):** 18,000 × 0.3MB ≈ 5.4GB

### Bandwidth Requirements
- **Viewing Patterns:** Users primarily view their own photos
- **Estimated Bandwidth:** 2-3x storage per month (re-viewing photos)
- **MVP:** ~2GB/month, **Growth:** ~15GB/month

## Cost Projections

### MVP Phase (200 users)
**Cloudinary Costs:**
- Storage: 720MB ≈ 1 credit
- Transformations: 2,400 photos ≈ 3 credits
- Bandwidth: 2GB ≈ 2 credits
- **Total: 6 credits (well within 25 credit free tier)**

**S3 Archival Costs:**
- Minimal for MVP phase
- **Total MVP Cost: $0/month**

### Growth Phase (1000 users)
**Cloudinary Costs:**
- Active photos (30 days): ~10 credits
- Bandwidth: ~15 credits
- **Total: ~25 credits (at free tier limit)**

**Hybrid Strategy Savings:**
- Archive 70% of photos to S3 after 30 days
- Reduces Cloudinary storage by ~70%
- **Estimated Total: $20-40/month** (within $100 budget)

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Cloudinary Foundation

CREATE TABLE catch_photos (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    catch_id BIGINT,
    cloudinary_public_id VARCHAR(255),
    s3_key VARCHAR(255) NULL, -- For archived photos
    original_filename VARCHAR(255),
    file_size INTEGER,
    width INTEGER,
    height INTEGER,
    metadata JSON, -- EXIF data if preserved
    storage_tier ENUM('cloudinary', 's3_archive'),
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP,
    archived_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Laravel Service Architecture

```php
// Photo storage service interface
interface PhotoStorageService {
    public function upload($file, $catch_id): Photo;
    public function getThumbnail($photo_id, $size): string;
    public function getFullSize($photo_id): string;
    public function archive($photo_id): bool;
    public function restore($photo_id): bool;
}

// Cloudinary implementation with S3 fallback
class HybridPhotoStorage implements PhotoStorageService {
    // Implementation details...
}
```
