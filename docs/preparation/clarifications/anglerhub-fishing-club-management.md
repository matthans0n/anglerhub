# AnglerHub Solo Angler MVP - Clarification

## Problem Statement & Scope

AnglerHub MVP is a focused digital platform designed specifically for independent solo anglers who want to track, analyze, and improve their fishing experiences. The platform replaces manual catch logging methods (paper logs, basic phone notes) with a comprehensive digital solution that captures rich data about each fishing experience and provides meaningful insights over time.

### Primary Users
- **Solo Anglers**: Independent anglers who want to log personal catches, track fishing statistics, set goals, access weather data, and maintain detailed fishing records for personal improvement and enjoyment

### MVP Scope
The system focuses exclusively on solo angler functionality:
1. **Personal Profile Management**: Simple registration and profile creation without club affiliations
2. **Rich Catch Logging**: Comprehensive catch data capture including photos, GPS, weather, species, and personal notes
3. **Personal Analytics**: Statistics tracking, history viewing, and progress monitoring
4. **Goal Setting**: Personal achievement tracking and milestone management
5. **Weather Integration**: Basic weather and tide information for fishing planning
6. **Data Export**: Personal data portability in standard formats
7. **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for field use with offline capabilities

**Future Phase**: Club management features (trip booking, member management, tournaments) will be developed after MVP validation and user feedback.

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

## Risks & Open Questions

### High Priority Risks
1. **Weather API Costs**: Third-party weather service costs may exceed $50/month budget with user growth
2. **Data Loss**: Solo angler catch data must be backed up and recoverable
3. **Privacy Compliance**: GPS and photo data handling must meet legal requirements
4. **Photo Storage Costs**: Image storage costs may scale beyond budget projections
5. **User Adoption**: Solo anglers may prefer traditional paper logs or simple phone notes

### Technical Risks
1. **Mobile Performance**: Image uploads and GPS tracking may consume significant bandwidth in remote fishing locations
2. **Offline Data Integrity**: Ensuring offline catch data doesn't corrupt during sync
3. **Weather API Reliability**: Third-party service outages affecting core functionality
4. **Photo Processing**: Large image files may cause app performance issues
5. **GPS Accuracy**: Poor GPS signal in remote locations affecting catch location data

### Open Questions
1. What pricing model for solo anglers after MVP (free vs freemium vs subscription)?
2. How much photo storage per user is reasonable for budget constraints?
3. Should the system include fishing license tracking and reminders?
4. What level of species database detail is needed (basic vs comprehensive)?
5. How should the system handle multiple fishing methods per catch?
6. Should there be any social features (optional sharing) or strictly private?
7. What offline storage limits are appropriate for mobile devices?
8. How should data export handle large photo files?
9. Should goal achievements include gamification elements?
10. What weather data accuracy is acceptable for integration with catch logging?

## Success Metrics

- 50+ solo anglers have created accounts and logged at least 1 catch
- 90% of catch logging completed via mobile interface
- Average of 3+ catches logged per active user
- 95% uptime for core features (registration, catch logging, history)
- Zero critical security incidents

### Growth Success (6 months)
- 200+ active solo angler accounts
- 70% of users log catches at least monthly
- 80% user retention rate (users who log 2+ catches return within 30 days)
- Average of 5+ catches per active user per month
- 85% user satisfaction score based on in-app feedback
- Weather API costs remain under $50/month
- Photo storage costs remain under $100/month

## Next Steps

Upon approval, the research phase should focus on:
1. Competitive analysis of existing solo angler apps and catch logging solutions
2. Weather API integration options and pricing models (OpenWeather, WeatherAPI, etc.)
3. Mobile development frameworks and offline capability options for catch logging
4. Database design for catch logging, user profiles, and statistics tracking
5. Photo storage solutions and image compression techniques for cost optimization
6. Security and compliance requirements for GPS and photo data handling
7. Species database options and maintenance requirements for North American fish
8. Authentication and user privacy controls implementation
9. Offline data storage and synchronization patterns for mobile apps
10. Performance optimization strategies for mobile catch logging workflow

This clarification document establishes the foundation for developing AnglerHub as a focused MVP platform that serves independent solo anglers with comprehensive catch logging, statistics tracking, and goal management features, with the flexibility to expand to club features in future phases.
