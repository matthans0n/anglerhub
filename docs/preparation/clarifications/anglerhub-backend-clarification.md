# Clarification for AnglerHub Laravel Backend Foundation

## Problem Statement

Test the implemented Laravel backend foundation for AnglerHub fishing app to ensure all acceptance criteria are met and the system is ready for frontend development.

## Scope

This testing phase covers the core Laravel backend functionality including:

- User authentication and API token management
- Catch logging and data storage
- Data retrieval with filtering capabilities
- Goal creation and progress tracking
- Input validation and error handling
- API response consistency
- Security implementations
- Database integrity and migrations

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: User Authentication & API Tokens
- Users can register new accounts
- Users can login with email/password
- System generates secure API tokens via Laravel Sanctum
- Tokens are required for protected endpoints
- Logout functionality revokes tokens

### AC-2: Catch Logging
- Required fields: species, location, caught_at (date/time)
- Optional fields: weight, length, photos, notes, bait/lure, technique
- GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude) support
- Weather data integration
- Catch validation and storage

### AC-3: Data Retrieval & Filtering
- List catches with pagination
- Filter by: species, date range, location, personal bests
- Search functionality across catch data
- Sort by date (newest first by default)
- Proper query scopes implemented

### AC-4: Location Management
- GPS coordinate storage with decimal precision
- Named location support
- Location-based filtering and search
- Distance calculations between catches

### AC-5: Goal Tracking
- Multiple goal types: species, weight, count, location
- Progress calculation based on catches
- Goal status management (active, completed, paused)
- Automatic progress updates

### AC-6: Data Validation
- Request validation rules for all endpoints
- Meaningful error messages
- Field-level validation feedback
- Proper HTTP status codes for errors

### AC-7: API Response Formatting
- Consistent JSON response structure
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Error response standardization
- Resource transformation consistency

### AC-8: Performance Requirements
- Database queries optimized
- Response times under 2 seconds
- Concurrent request handling
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields

### AC-9: Security Implementation
- API endpoints protected by authentication
- Input sanitization and validation
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting considerations
- CORS configuration

### AC-10: Database Integrity
- Foreign key constraints enforced
- Migration rollback safety
- Data consistency across relationships
- Proper cascade behaviors

## Test Strategy

1. **Setup Phase**: Verify environment and run migrations
2. **Authentication Tests**: Test user registration, login, and token generation
3. **CRUD Operations**: Test all catch and goal management endpoints
4. **Query Tests**: Verify filtering, sorting, and search functionality
5. **Validation Tests**: Test input validation and error handling
6. **Security Tests**: Verify authentication and authorization
7. **Performance Tests**: Basic load and response time validation
8. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation

## Success Criteria

- All 10 acceptance criteria are demonstrably met
- All 5 acceptance examples pass testing
- Existing Pest test suite passes completely
- No security vulnerabilities identified
- API documentation matches implementation
- Database migrations run cleanly
